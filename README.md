<!-- About the Project -->
### About The Project
This is the public repository for the recruiting application the 506th IRRU uses for its inprocessing of new unit members. The general flow is a new applicant joins the 506th Discord, opens a ticket using the ["Tickets" bot ](https://dashboard.ticketsbot.net/). A recruiter will join the ticket with the applicant and using another discord bot ["YAGPDB"](https://yagpdb.xyz/) complete a series of modals to collect information from the applicant. 

This is designed to be more user friendly and streamlined for all parties involved, from the applicant/recruiter to the S-3 Training and S-1 Personnel processing the information.

Documentation will be provided within this repo to walk recruiters how to use the software.

<!-- Contributing -->
### Contributing

Because the application currently uses the scripting language provided with YAGPDB, accepting contributions direcrly is incredibly difficult.  

If you would like to contribute to the project, please submit bugs and suggestions to Crowxar via Discord or through the appropriate links below.

Thanks!
